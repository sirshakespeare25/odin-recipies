        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 red grapefruit, refrigerated </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon softened butter </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon brown sugar </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons brown sugar </li>
            <li> aluminum foil </li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <li>

            Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
            
            Cut grapefruit in half crosswise and slice off a thin sliver off the bottom of each half if the fruit isn't sitting flat. Use a sharp paring knife to cut around the outside edge of the grapefruit and between each segment to make the fruit easier to eat once cooked.</li>
            <li>
            
            Combine softened butter and 1 tablespoon brown sugar in a small bowl. Spread mixture over each grapefruit half. Sprinkle with remaining brown sugar.</li>
            <li>
            
            Cut aluminum foil into two 5-inch squares and place each grapefruit half on one square; fold up the edges to catch any juices. Set in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>
            
            Broil in the air fryer until sugar mixture is bubbling, 6 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle fruit with cinnamon before serving.</li>
