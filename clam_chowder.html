        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams, undrained</li>
            <li>water as needed</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>4 cups peeled and cubed Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups evaporated skim milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon potato starch (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain clam juice from 2 of the cans into a 2-cup measuring cup and fill with water to the 2-cup mark; set aside. Drain and discard clam juice from the remaining can.
            </li>
            <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add bacon and stir occasionally until fat has rendered and bacon is cooked, but not crispy, about 5 minutes. Add onion and butter. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot to get up all of the brown bits, until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Hit Cancel.
            </li>
            <li>Add potatoes and reserved clam juice-water mixture; stir. Close and lock the lid and seal the pressure valve. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 4 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
            </li>
            <li>Allow to rest for 3 minutes, then release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
            </li>
            <li>Carefully mash some or all of the potatoes as desired with a potato masher. Select Soup function. Stir in flour, thyme, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Add evaporated milk and drained clams. Heat the soup without boiling, about 5 minutes. Add potato starch to thicken soup, if desired.
